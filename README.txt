Steps to run:

1. Navigate to the folder where the main.py file is using the cd command in the mac terminal
 cd <name of folder to open>
 ls (shows current folders in director)

cd Downloads
cd Narakeet
ls

Should always be those 3 commands

2. type "python3 main.py" and press enter

3. Provide your api key for narakeet when prompted. Press enter.

4. provide the file name of the csv file that contains the text you want to generate into audio. This file must be in the same folder as the main.py and you only need to provide the name of the file, not the extension.
   So for example you would type in "test" and then press enter
